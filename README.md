# Data-Science-Journey
Here I will show my journey through Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science.
This Journey will begin with the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron. 

Now I'm focused on Computer Vision to develop my thesis.
