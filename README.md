# Data-Science-Journey
Here I will show my journey through Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science.
This Journey will begin with the book Data Science From Scratch by Joel Grus  covering the basics, while developing some projects, following that I will cover Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron.
